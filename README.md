A mock cliffhanger game as seen on The Price is Right

To play, load the html page in a web browser. Type in a 2 digit number (12, 03, etc) and the yodeler will move up the mountain that many spaces. If the yodeler moves more than 25 spaces he will fall of the mountain.

In the Price is Right game "Cliff Hangers," contestants bid on the prices of three items, and for every dollar off, a mountain climber moves up a mountain, aiming to avoid falling off the edge. The goal is to keep the climber from going over the cliff by accurately pricing the items. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown of the game:

**The Setup:**
The game features a stylized mountain slope with a scale from 0 to 25, representing the number of dollars a contestant can be off in their bids. At the start, a mountain climber is at the base (0). 

**The Challenge:**
Contestants are shown three prizes and must bid on their prices, one by one. 

**The Climb:**
For each item, if the bid is correct, the climber stays put. If the bid is incorrect, the climber moves up the mountain, one step for each dollar the bid is off. 

**The Cliff:**
The climber continues from the point where they stopped for the previous prize. If the climber reaches the top of the mountain (25), the game ends, and the contestant loses. 

**The Prize:**
If the climber doesn't go over the cliff, the contestant keeps any small prizes won up to that point. 

**The Suspense:**
The actual price is not revealed until after the climber has moved, adding an element of suspense.
